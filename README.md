# Super-Slash-Sisters-Scuffle

I wrote this parody game of Super Smash Bros Brawl in the eleventh grade with a friend of mine as a joke. Our lack of experience culminated into a project with poor documentation and overcomplicated code. This project, though fun to write, also functions as reminder for me to search for preexisting libraries and to document my code in order to facilitate the development process. 

Note that we only managed to implement the feature for the character Moria to change the direction he's facing before we moved on to more worthy undertakings. 

The game can be accessed here: https://super-slash-sisters.anttimeriluoto.repl.co/
